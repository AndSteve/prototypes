JS For Loops

Prototype

Build an array and loop through it

Create an array the contains at least five values of your choosing
Build a for loop that will use console.log to log out each value in your array to the console
Hint - for(var i=0; i < myArray.length; i++){...}
Hint - Place the console.log() between the {} of your for loop
Reminder - To access values in an array: myArray[0] Try replacing the 0 with i
Save your work and test your code, notice the output in the console
In the for loop you just created add an additional console.log() to log out the i variable
Hint - console.log("i is equal to:", i);
Save your work and test your code, notice the output in the console
note your new output for i
More array looping fun!

Create the exact following array
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
Using a for loop, output all the numbers in ascending order, 1-10
Save your work and test your code
Using the same array from above write a different for loop that outputs all the numbers in descending order, 10-1
Save your work and test your code
Using the same array again write yet another for loop that only outputs odd numbers, 1 3 5 7...
Using your exact for loop from the previous step (#6), try using the following array
var mixedArray = [4, 56, 11, 13, 97, 22, 7, 36, 19, 5, 8, 10];
Does it still only output odd numbers?
If not can you fix it?
For in loop

Given the following object
var seats = {seat1: 'Stu', seat2: 'Peggy', seat3: 'LoneStar', seat4: 'George', seat5: 'Mike'}
Use a for in loop to loop through each key value pair
Create the following output Stu is in seat1 Peggy is in seat2 and so on ...
Don't forget to test all of your work
