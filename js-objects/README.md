# Prototype 1: Student Object
- Create an object (student_object) that holds the name and grade (0-100) of a student
- Fill that object with data for a mock student

# Prototype 2: 
- Create a function (add_student()) that 
	- prompts for the student's name
	- prompts for the student's grade
	- creates the student_object from above, and inserts the new data into it
	- Add the object to a global array (student_array)
- Attach add_student function to a button (add student) on your index page

# Prototype 3: 
- Create a div on your page to serve as a student display area
- Create a button(add student) 
- Make a function (list_students()) and attached to button.  It should
	- list all current students (from the array) into the student display area.  
	- List each student with an ID of their place in the area (0, 1, 2, 3, etc).  So for example: 15) Daniel Paschal - 75

# Prototype 4:
- Create a new function and button (delete student) to delete a student
- Function should 
	- prompt for an ID number
	- delete the student corresponding with that ID number
	- call the list_students() function after deleting the student
