## Javascript - Primitive Data Types

## Getting Started

### Step - 1
- Fork this repo
- Clone your forked copy to your local machine

### Step - 2
- Create an index.html file inside the `js-primitive-data-types` folder
- DO NOT edit this README

### Step - 3 
- Build out a standard HTML skeleton including:
	- DOCTYPE tag
	- HTML tag
	- head tag
	- body tag

### Step - 4 
- In your 'head' tag add a 'script' tag
	- Don't forget to close out your 'script' tag
	- Example: ` <script> </script> `

## Prototype - 1

### Create three variables inside your script tag
- Create a variable `firstName`, set it to your first name
- Create a variable `lastName`, set it to your last name
- create a variable `age`, set it to your age

### Use console.log
- Using `console.log()` in your script tag log out a string as follows
	- Use your own data to create a string that looks similar to:
	- "First name: Marry
	   Last name: Smith
	   Age: 57"

### Two more Variables
- Create two more variables 
	- Create a variable `x`, set it equal to any whole number between 1-100
	- Create a variable `y`, set it equal to any DIFFERENT whole number between 1-100

### Log out some more info
- Using three separate `console.log()` in your script tag log out the following:
- As an example I'll choose 12 and 55
	- Output 1: the total of `x` and `y`
		- Example output: `67`
	- Output 2: x and y concatenated 
		- Example output: `"1255"`
	- Output 3: Text concatenated with the total of `x` and `y`
		- Example output: `"The total of x and y are 67"`
